# SQL #

## SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. ##

### To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned. ###

### In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not. ##
## More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous AND or OR logical keywords ##

## A database is nothing but a collection of organized data ##

##  The formal term for a column in a database is a field and a row is known as a record. ##
