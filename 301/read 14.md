## Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.  ##

## There are three normal forms most databases adhere to using.  ##
## 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form. They are also abbreviated as 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF ##

## There are three main reasons to normalize a database.  The first is to minimize duplicate data, the second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues, and the third is to simplify queries.  ##

## First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.

## Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.

## Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key ##
